Test Scenario:
-----------------
It is high level Testcase. It is an idea of what we are going to test.

Test Case:
-------------
It is an idea of how we are going to test, it includes tc name, test data, expected & actual results,status,etc.

Test Data:
-------------
The actual input which we are going to use in the application for testing.

Defect:
---------
When the expected and actual is not matching, then it is a defect. In other words, when the application does not conform to the
requirement specification.

Bug:
------
When the tester raise a defect to developer then it is called as bug


Levels of Testing:
----------------------

--> The testing done at various levels and by whom it is done is called Levels of Testing.
--> There are 4 levels of testing. If theses 4 levels of testing is completed only, we can say the application is ready for release.

1.Unit Testing - Developers
2.Integration Testing - Testers with help of developers
3.System Testing - Testers
4.Acceptance Testing - Client


1.Unit Testing:
------------------
--> Testing an individual module in an application
--> Done by Developers 
--> Test based on White Box Testing Technique.


2.Integration Testing:
---------------------------
--> Combining or merging two modules
--> Done by Testers with the help of developers
--> Test based on Black Box Testing Techniques
--> Top-down Approach - Higher level combinations of units
--> Bottom-up Approach -  Lower level combinations of units
--> Big Bang Approach - Combining all combination of units


3.System Testing:
---------------------
--> Complete Application Testing
--> Done by Testers
--> Test based on Black Box Testing Technique
--> Types of System Testing:
	--> Functional Testing - To test the functionalities of the application
	--> Usability Testing - To test whether the application is user friendly and it is easily understandable
	--> Performance Testing - To test whether the application is not getting crashed or down when there is load/stress
	--> Security Testing - To test whether the application is secure or not
--> If theses 4 types of testing is completed only, we can say system testing is completed.


4.Acceptance Testing:
---------------------
--> Satisfying client requirement
--> Done by client side
--> Getting approval from client
--> Testing will be done at Development/Testing Environment
