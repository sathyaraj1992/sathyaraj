SDLC Methodologies:
---------------------------
1.WaterFall Model
2.V-Model Of Testing
3.Iterative Model
4.Agile Model


1.Waterfall Model:
-------------------------
-->Simple and easy to understand for use.
-->Each phase has specific deliverables and review processes.
-->Documentation or artifacts maintained properly.
-->Suitable for projects where requirements are well understood.

Disadvatages:
------------------
-->Not suitable for projects where requirements are at a risk of changing.
-->Cost of fixing defects is very high when detected at a later stage.
-->Not a good model for complex and long projects.


2.V-Model:
--------------
-->The V-model is an SDLC model where execution of processes happens in a sequential manner in a V-shape. 
-->It is also known as Verification and Validation model.

3.Iterative Model:
-----------------------
We are going to iterate each functionality in to each part and design,develop and test and deploy.

4.Agile Model:
-------------------
AGILE methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
Here both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model.

Why we go for Agile?
---------------------------
-->More Control
-->Better Productivity
-->Better Quality
-->Higher Customer Satisfaction
-->Higher return on investment


Agile Manifesto(Principles):
------------------------------------
-->Individual and team interactions over processes and tools
-->Working software over comprehensive documentation
-->Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
-->Responding to change over following a plan

[Note: Framework we are following in Agile is Scrum.] 

Agile:
--------
-->Roles
-->Artifacts/Documents
-->Cermonies/Meeting

Members/Role Players in Agile:
----------------------------------------
--> Product Owner:
      ---------------------
	-->Product Owner defines features of the product and decides release date.
	-->Product Owner prioritize the features according to the market value and profitability of the product.
	-->Product Owner can accept or reject work item result.

--> Scrum Master:
      -------------------
	-->Scrum Master manages the team and look after the team's productivity.
	-->Scrum Master is responsible for setting up the team, scrum meeting invite and removes obstacles to progress.

--> Scrum Team/Dev Team:
      ------------------------------
	-->The team is usually about 5-9 members.
   	-->The whole team involved in development and testing.
	-->Team manages its own work and organizes the work to complete the sprint or cycle.
	-->And attend the scrum meetings
