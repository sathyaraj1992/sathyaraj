Different Types of Testing:
---------------------------------

White Box Testing:
------------------------
It is based on applications internal coding knowledge. It is done by developers. White Box Testing is also called as 
Glass Box, Clear Box, and Structural Testing. 

Black Box Testing:
-----------------------
Testers evaluate the functionality of the software without looking at the internal coding knowledge. It is done by testers.

Positive Testing:
--------------------
It is to determine what system supposed to do.
 It helps to check whether the application is justifying the requirements or not.

Negative Testing:
----------------------
It is to determine what system not supposed to do. It helps to find the defects from the software.

Formal Testing:
--------------------
It is a process where the testers test the application by having pre-planned procedures and proper documentation.

Informal Testing:
----------------------
It is a process where the testers test the application without having any pre-planned procedures and proper documentation.

Monkey Testing:
---------------------
Perform abnormal action on the application deliberately in order to verify the stability of the application.

ReTesting:
-------------
Once the developer fix the bug and we need to test again whether the bug is fixed or not.

Smoke Testing:
-------------------
Smoke Testing is done to make sure if the build we received from the development team is testable or not. 
It is also called as “Day 0” check. It is done at the “build level”. It helps not to waste the testing time to simply testing the 
whole application when the key features don’t work.

Regression Testing:
------------------------
It is done to make sure the existing functionalities of the application is not impacted whenever any new functionalities is added
to the application.

Sanity Testing:
-------------------
Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper. 
It is also called as a subset of Regression testing. It is done at the “release level”. 
At times due to release time constraints regression testing can’t be done to the build, sanity testing does that part 
by checking main functionalities.

Beta Testing:
-----------------
Beta testing is done by a limited number of end users before delivery. Usually, it is done in the client place.

Live Environment Testing:
---------------------------------
It it nothing but testing the application in live environment (i.e) After Release.
