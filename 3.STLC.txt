STLC Overview:
---------------------
--> Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is defined as a sequence of activities conducted to perform Software Testing.
--> Each of these stages have a definite Entry and Exit criteria; 

Entry Criteria:
-------------------
Entry Criteria gives the prerequisite items that must be completed before testing can begin.

Exit Criteria: 
-----------------
Exit Criteria defines the items that must be completed before testing can be concluded.

Phases of STLC:
---------------------
1.Requirement Analysis
2.Test Planning
3.Test Design
4.Test execution
5.Sign Off


1.Requirement Analysis:
------------------------------
Entry Criteria: BR Document and Design Specification Document

--> Understanding the requirements
--> Clarification of doubts in query logs through walkthrough session
--> Identify types of tests to be performed
--> Get application access

Exit Criteria: Finalized scope.


2.Test Planning: 
--------------------
Entry Criteria: Finalized scope

--> Done by testing team lead
--> Preparation of test plan document for various types of testing
--> Inscope and Outscope
--> Test tool selection  
--> Date Calculation
--> Resource planning

Exit Criteria: Test Plan Document.


3.Test Design:
-----------------
Entry Criteria: Test Plan Document

--> Create test case document with test scenario, test case and test data
--> Review test cases with peer or lead
--> Get Approval from BA
--> Automation testers will do skeleton script
--> RTM(Requiremnet Tracability Matrix) will be done by Testing Team Lead

Exit Criteria: Test Case Document, RTM.


4.Test Execution:
----------------------
Entry Criteria: Test Case Document, RTM

--> Execute tests as per plan
--> Raise defects and Track the defects to closure
--> Document test results, and log defects for failed cases 

Exit Criteria: Execution  Result, Defect Log.


5.Sign Off:
---------------
Entry Criteria: Execution  Result, Defect Log

--> Will be done by Testing Team Manager
--> Test result analysis
--> Evaluate cycle completion
--> Prepare Test closure report 


Exit Criteria: Closure Document.
