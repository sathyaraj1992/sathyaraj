Equivalence partitioning Technique:
----------------------------------------------
-->In equivalence partitioning, the test cases are eqaully divided based upon positive and negative inputs.

	-->Example: Consider that we have to select an age between 18-56, 
	 	    Here the Valid inputs are 18-56 and the invalid inputs are <=17 and =>57.
	 	    Here we have one valid and two invalid inputs. 

Decision Table Technique:
---------------------------------
-->In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs.
-->To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.
-->We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs.

	-->Example: Login validation - Allow user to login only when both the username and password is correct.
	  	   Conditions 1: Enter valid username and valid password and Click Login.
	  	    Actions    1: Display home page and Execute.

		   Conditions 2: Enter invalid username and valid password and Click Login.
	  	   Actions    2: Display Error message as invalid username.
	  
	  
State Transition Technique:
-----------------------------------
-->Using state transition testing, we pick test cases from an application where we need to test different system transitions.
-->We can apply this when an application gives a different output for the same input,depending on what has happened in the earlier state.

	-->Example: Login with invalid username and password three times keeps the account page blocked until change password.


Boundary Value Analysis:
--------------------------------
-->Boundary value analysis is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions.
-->Every partition has its maximum and minimum values 
     and these maximum and minimum values are the boundary values of a partition.

	-->Example: If we want to enter an amount between 100 to 1000.
                  		   Here we check based on boundaries for 100, we take 98,99,101,102 and for 1000, we take 998,999,1001,1002.


Error Guessing Technique:
-------------------------
-->Error Guessing is used to find bugs in software application based on testers prior experience. 
-->Here we won't follow any specific rules.

Adhoc Testing:
------------------
-->Ad-hoc testing is an informal testing type.  
-->In Adhoc testing, testers randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques. 
-->This testing is primarily performed if the knowledge of testers in the application under test is very high.
